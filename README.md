Task Management App
React app that lets you add and delete tasks. Deleted tasks are saved in case the User did not fully intend to delete the task. This app is mobile-friendly and uses a sliding navbar for phones or iPads. Users can enter in more details for each task. When the User clicks on the saved task, appropriate task expands out to display the details.

Future Improvements/Additions:
Add database for persistent storage
Add ability to login and user authentication
Add reactive calendar/alerts for tasks that have due dates/deadlines
Add Progress Bar to visually track progress of open tasks that need to get done
